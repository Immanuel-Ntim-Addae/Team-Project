#PROJECT PROPOSAL: Project Dangerous Weather.

### The Big Idea
**‘Project Dangerous Weather’** is a programming project that aspires to create a travel web application that will allow the user to get travel suggestions based upon their preferred weather conditions, the distance they are willing to travel, and the safety of the location. 
For this project, the Minimum Viable Product is creating an application that generates five suggestions based upon weather and a “safety score”. It will rank them by safety score, from highest to lowest. 
**My stretch goals** are the following:
-	Aesthetically Pleasing Interface with interesting text
-	Providing distance of user from Major Cities that fit their query. 
-	Being able to download a file containing suggestions. 
-	Showing (if available) opinions on locations from Reddit. 
-	Provide links to new articles to learn more about a location. 
In attempting this project, I plan to **explore using different APIs** to communicate information to my web application, as well as **develop an aesthetically pleasing website**. 

### Learning Objectives
My learning goals are to expand upon my capabilities to use multiple API within the same project in order to create better software. I want to also learn how to code better—in the sense of style and efficiency. How can I make one function shorter? How can I break up a function to improve programming flexibility? I also want to revisit my abilities to make good HTML websites. 
### Project Schedule: 
**Week 1 -2: API Documentation and Testing**
-	Here, I will find the right APIs for the project, and read the documentation on them. I will also conduct a series of “tests” (i.e. create small programs) to understand the data structure and the way I need to use each API differently. 
-	I will also need to understand how to categorize weather so that users can input more general weather inputs, and find regions of similarity. For example, the term “Tropical” has all sorts of weather implications. I need to understand what makes a region tropical. This will impact the API’s I choose, and also how I implement my solution. 
**Week 3 - 4: API Implementation**
-	I predict this may take longer, given that even understanding the data structure, It may be more difficult to actually get to use the API for my specific purposes. I give myself two weeks to practice with the API and finally start working on gathering weather data from several locations, and safety scores. 
-	In order to do this, I predict I will need to create a weather module, that takes in user input for weather, and returns a series of locations that fit those specific weather options. I will also need to create a “Safety Score” module that will take user input and search for locations that fit the user input. 
**Week 5- 6: Developing the Aesthetics and Web-Elements and Troubleshooting**
Here, I will focus on developing the website part of my project using Flash. I provide 2 weeks for this part of the project due to wanting to have a very ood looking website, but also to properly explore web development options. Ialso want at least a week for troubleshooting code and testing the whole program with different options and issues. 

### Risks and Limitations
**Limitations:**
-	Beginner Programming: My ability to program is limited by my knowledge, even if Chat GPT and other sources can help. This knowledge also limits the efficiency of my solutions. 
-	Dirty Programming: While I can make a program, I often have the tendency to write ‘dirty’ programs: in the sense that these programs involve unnecessary elements, many for loops and take longer to run than they should. I will need to avoid this tendency using style guides and carefully thinking through my implementations. 
**Risks:** 
-	Project Non-Completion: This is a reality for all projects. Due to complications outside the scope of the Project, I may fall behind and produce a project that only provides the minimum viable product. 
**Additional Course Content:**
-	I believe that being able to scrape the web for popular tourist images to use on my site may be very helpful for making the website look awesome.
