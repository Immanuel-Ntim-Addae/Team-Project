1) Create a data frame / csv document to contain the following information:
Country; Climate Zone Classification; Average Temperature (Annual); Average Temp Range; Average Precipitation (Annual); Precip Range.
Note: For Average (ANNUAL) precipiation, we might want to divide by 365 to get a daily precipitation number to fit our temperature number. 
2) So a user should be able to select from a variety of categorical variables in order to find the climate they want for vacation, and select a temperature range they are okay.
